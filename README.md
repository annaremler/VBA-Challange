# Module-2-VBA-Challange
Module 2 Assignment for UCB Extention Bootcamp (Digital Analysis)

## Purpose of this project 
<p> The point of this projects is to use VBA to help us analyze the stocks of 2018, 2019 and 2020. There are 12 different tickers and over 3,000 rows of data. Our goal is to look at each ticker and see the total volume and return that they are getting in each year. A script was written in VBA that allows us to type in the year we would like data for (in this case, 2018-20), and then the script generates the results and formats them. <br>

  The 2017 findings show that most of the tickers had a positive return and were safe investments. The Particular one that Steve's parents were looking into was DQ which had the greatest return of all. For the 2018 you can see that the returns were not nearly as high and the total volumes were down as well. I think some of the reason for this was because if you look at the very top of the data in the 2018 spread sheet you can see the prices went up a bit. </p>
